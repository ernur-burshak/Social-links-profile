<q>Front-end developer and avid reader.</q>
```

```css
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

```css
ul {
  list-style-type: none;
}
```

```css
li {
  cursor: url("../assets/images/handcursor.svg"), pointer;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease, color 0.3s ease;
}
```

```css
li:hover a {
  color: #333333;
}
```

```css
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
  .card {
    width: 384px;
    max-width: 456px;
  }
